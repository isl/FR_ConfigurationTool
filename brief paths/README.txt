						Brief paths

For reasons of efficiency, some big FRs have been re-written using custom owlim rules.
In this folder you can find these FRs and the new shorter paths. 
We have not replaced the big paths with these in the respective folders (existing in ./Fundamental folder)
because we want to maintain the full paths to maintain the functionality of the 'Fundametal Relationships configuration tool'.
If in the future new rules are made and more paths are to be shortend we suggest NOT to replace the big ones with the short ones,
but to keep the short version in this folder.
The rules created for this purpose can be found in the sesame set up folder, under the path ./sesameSetup/ontotext_owlim/Rules_custom_big.pie
